# Deep Learning on Hyperspectral Satellite Imagery

This repository is dedicated to Home Assignment 2 project on GeoSpatial Data Science Course of HSE. The topic is Deep Learning on Hyperspectral Satellite Imagery.  
In this project i tried to recreate approach from [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9259864).  As a part of the assignment I had to record a presentation on my work so please make sure to watch the [video](https://youtu.be/kea_MU6g6Os) and view the presentation to learn on the insights of this task.
